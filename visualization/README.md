### TensorBoard

A visualization toolkit for TensorFlow, useful for visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy, as well as model graphs.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Monitoring training progress, visualizing computational graphs, and more.

## Available Scripts

### `plot_training_metrics.py`

**Purpose:**  
Generates plots for training loss and accuracy over epochs to monitor the training progress of the neural network.

**Usage:**

```bash
python visualization/plot_training_metrics.py --log_path logs/train.json.log --output_path visualizations/training_metrics.png
````

### `plot_model_performance.py`

**Purpose:**  
Visualizes model performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess the effectiveness of the trained model.

**Usage:**

```bash
python visualization/plot_model_performance.py --metrics_path logs/evaluation_results.csv --output_path visualizations/model_performance.png
```

### `generate_reports.py`

**Purpose:**  
Compiles various visualizations into a comprehensive report, facilitating easy review and sharing of model performance and training insights.

**Usage:**

```bash
python visualization/generate_reports.py --input_dir visualizations/ --report_path reports/model_report.pdf
```

## Usage

### Generating Training Metrics Plots

1. **Ensure Logs are Available:**
    
    Make sure that the training logs (`train.json.log`) are present in the `logs/` directory.
    
2. **Run the Plotting Script:**
    
    ```bash
    python visualization/plot_training_metrics.py --log_path logs/train.json.log --output_path visualizations/training_metrics.png
    ```
    
3. **View the Output:**
    
    The generated plot `training_metrics.png` will be available in the `visualizations/` directory.
    

### Visualizing Model Performance

1. **Ensure Evaluation Results are Available:**
    
    Make sure that the evaluation results (`evaluation_results.csv`) are present in the `logs/` directory.
    
2. **Run the Plotting Script:**
    
    ```bash
    python visualization/plot_model_performance.py --metrics_path logs/evaluation_results.csv --output_path visualizations/model_performance.png
    ```
    
3. **View the Output:**
    
    The generated plot `model_performance.png` will be available in the `visualizations/` directory.
    

### Creating Comprehensive Reports

1. **Ensure All Visualizations are Generated:**
    
    Generate all necessary plots using the available scripts.
    
2. **Run the Report Generation Script:**
    
    ```bash
    python visualization/generate_reports.py --input_dir visualizations/ --report_path reports/model_report.pdf
    ```
    
3. **View the Report:**
    
    The compiled report `model_report.pdf` will be available in the `reports/` directory.
    

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming:**  
    Use clear and descriptive names for visualization files to easily identify their content and purpose.
    
- **Automate Visualization Generation:**  
    Integrate visualization scripts into the training and evaluation pipelines to automatically generate plots upon completion of tasks.
    
- **Interactive Dashboards:**  
    Utilize interactive tools like Plotly or Dash to create dynamic dashboards that allow for in-depth exploration of metrics.
    
- **Documentation:**  
    Document the purpose and usage of each visualization script to facilitate ease of use and collaboration.
    
- **Version Control:**  
    Track changes to visualization scripts and configurations using Git to maintain a history of modifications and enhancements.
    

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Logs or Data Files:**
    
    - **Solution:**  
        Ensure that all required log and data files are present in their respective directories before running visualization scripts.
- **Plotting Errors:**
    
    - **Solution:**  
        Verify that the input files are correctly formatted and contain the necessary data. Check for missing or malformed entries.
- **Library Issues:**
    
    - **Solution:**  
        Ensure that all required Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) are installed. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
- **File Permission Issues:**
    
    - **Solution:**  
        Ensure that the scripts have the necessary permissions to read input files and write output files. Modify permissions if necessary.
