> **Self-evolving neural networks that adapt in real-time based on data complexity!**

## 🚀 The Vision & Our "Divide and Conquer" Reality

This project is a unique frontier in deep learning development. It was originally generated entirely by AI, leading to a sprawling architecture filled with highly advanced, futuristic concepts.

While the AI successfully outlined an ambitious framework for a model that dynamically routes data based on execution complexity (variance, entropy, sparsity), it also *hallucinated* dozens of scripts leveraging non-existent PyTorch terminology (e.g. "Quantum Particle Swarms", "Consciousness Engines", and "AR Penetration Testing").

**Our Current Architecture Strategy:**
We are actively building this framework using a strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD) "Divide and Conquer" approach**. We take the AI's visionary goals and systematically replace the hallucinated modules with mathematically verified, strictly tested, functional PyTorch logic.

The core `src/` directory represents our **grounded, working pipeline** that successfully executes dynamic complexity routing on standard hardware.

## 🧠 The AI Dream Lab (`/AI_DREAM_LAB`)

What do we do with the futuristic, hallucinated AI code that doesn't actually compile? **We keep it.**

Inside the `AI_DREAM_LAB/` directory, you will find preserved scripts that the AI dreamed up when designing this project. These files represent an incubator for pure AI creativity. While they use non-existent terminology, we analyze the *intentions* and *aims* of these sci-fi scripts to outline actionable **Game Plans**.

Eventually, concepts like the hallucinated "Quantum Biological Network" will be reverse-engineered and rebuilt as real, state-of-the-art Deep Learning modules (like *Mixture-of-Experts Dynamic Routing*) inside our main working `src/` framework!

## ✨ Key Verified Features (In Production)

- 🔄 **Real-time Architecture Adaptation**: Networks dynamically route deep vs shallow paths based on live data batch complexities.
- 📉 **Strict TDD Reliability**: Every active module in `src/` is mathematically backed by a rigorous PyTorch unit test.
- ⚙️ **Hybrid Threshold Annealing**: As the model trains, it conditionally adjusts how difficult data needs to be before taking the deep path.
- 🔌 **Standardized API Hooks**: Built-in FastAPI integration in `src/app.py` for end-to-end inference prediction.

## 🛠️ Installation

Get started with a few simple commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/redx94/Dynamic-Neural-Network-Refinement.git
cd Dynamic-Neural-Network-Refinement

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install strictly verified PyTorch dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

After installation, kick off the dynamic refinement training loop on the MNIST dataset with:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```
*(Customize config parameters inside `config/train_config.yaml`)*

## 📚 Testing & Verification

Because we are wrangling AI hallucinations into reality, testing is mandatory. To verify the math and stability of the entire repository, run:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to both our Grounded architecture and our Dream Lab! 
Whether you're writing a strict Unit Test to fix a broken module, OR you're submitting a wildly futuristic pseudo-code hallucination to the Dream lab for us to decode later, we want you on board.
