> Self-evolving neural networks that adapt in real-time based on data complexity

## 🚀 Overview

Dynamic Neural Network Refinement (DNNR) revolutionizes deep learning by enabling neural networks to autonomously adapt their architectures based on real-time data complexity. Unlike traditional static models, DNNR networks evolve during both training and inference, optimizing themselves for better performance and efficiency.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-time Architecture Adaptation**: Networks automatically adjust their structure based on data complexity
- 📈 **Performance-Driven Evolution**: Continuous optimization using metrics like variance, entropy, and sparsity
- 🔌 **Easy Integration**: Seamless integration with existing PyTorch projects
- 🚅 **Distributed Training**: Built-in support for multi-GPU and multi-node training
- 📊 **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for real-time insights
- 🔒 **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive testing, CI/CD, and security measures

## 🛠️ Installation

Get started with a few simple commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/redx94/Dynamic-Neural-Network-Refinement.git
cd Dynamic-Neural-Network-Refinement

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

After installation, kick off the dynamic refinement process with:

```bash
python run_refinement.py --config config/example_config.json
```

Customize the provided configuration to tailor the refinement process to your specific requirements. Detailed usage instructions and parameter descriptions are available in our [Documentation](docs/).
