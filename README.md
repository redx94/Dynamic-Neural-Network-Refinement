## Overview

A revolutionary neural network framework that combines quantum computing principles with biological neural mechanisms to create emergent intelligence patterns. The system dynamically adapts its architecture based on real-time complexity metrics, utilizing quantum-biological integration for unprecedented learning capabilities.

## Key Features

### Core Technologies
- **Quantum-Biological Neural Network:** Fusion of quantum computing and biological neural mechanisms
- **Meta-Consciousness Engine:** Advanced recursive self-awareness processing
- **Dynamic Architecture Adjustment:** Real-time network refinement based on complexity metrics
- **Emergent Intelligence Patterns:** Self-organizing pattern recognition and formation

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Quantum Membrane Processing:** Simulates quantum field interactions and superposition states
- **Biological Synapse Dynamics:** Models neurotransmitter behavior and neural firing patterns
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS):** Automated optimal architecture discovery
- **Adaptive Threshold Implementation:** Dynamic complexity-based routing
- **Per-Sample Complexity Handling:** Real-time complexity assessment and adaptation

### Development Features
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana integration
- **API Server:** FastAPI-based model serving
- **Data Management:** Versioning and validation tools
- **Performance Optimization:** Profiling and benchmarking utilities

## Installation

```bash
