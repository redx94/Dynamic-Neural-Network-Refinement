# Dynamic Neural Network Refinement

## Overview
This repository contains the full implementation of the Dynamic Neural Network Refinement project, 
focusing on adaptive thresholds, complexity-based routing, dataset diversification, and advanced scalability.

## Features
- **Adaptive Threshold Implementation**: Gradient sensitivity analysis combined with hybrid thresholds.
- **Per-Sample Complexity Handling**: Dynamic batch processing and drift analysis.
- **Dataset Diversification**: Conditional GANs for synthetic data generation.
- **Neural Architecture Search**: Resource-aware NAS with meta-learning.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time visualization and interpretability using Captum and Plotly Dash.
- **Scalability Optimizations**: Structured pruning and quantization for deployment efficiency.
