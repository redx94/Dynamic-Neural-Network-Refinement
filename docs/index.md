## Overview

Dynamic Neural Network Refinement is designed to adapt and optimize neural network architectures during training and inference. By analyzing complexity metrics such as variance, entropy, and sparsity, the system can make informed decisions to modify the network's structure, leading to improved efficiency and performance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Architecture Adjustment:** Automatically refines neural network layers based on real-time data complexity.
- **Distributed Training:** Supports scalable training across multiple GPUs or machines using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose configurations facilitate easy deployment and environment setup.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions workflows automate testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrates Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring, along with structured logging for efficient log management.
- **Model Serving:** FastAPI-based API serves models for inference, ensuring quick and reliable predictions.
- **Data Versioning and Validation:** Utilizes DVC for data management and Great Expectations for robust data validation.
- **Performance Profiling and Benchmarking:** Tools and scripts to profile and benchmark both training and inference processes.
- **Automated Model Export:** Exports models to formats like ONNX for broader compatibility.
- **Code Quality Enforcement:** Pre-commit hooks and CI workflows maintain high code standards.
