# Best Practices

Maintaining high-quality code and efficient workflows is crucial for the success and sustainability of the **Dynamic Neural Network Refinement** project. This guide outlines the best practices to follow when contributing to or working with the project.

## 1. Coding Standards

### a. Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance:**  
  Adhere to [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines for Python code to ensure readability and consistency.
  
- **Formatting with Black:**  
  Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for automatic code formatting. Black enforces a consistent code style and reduces the time spent on code reviews.
  
  ```bash
  make format
  ````

- **Linting with Flake8:**  
    Utilize [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to detect syntax errors, undefined names, and other potential issues.
    
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```
    

### b. Documentation

- **Docstrings:**  
    Provide clear and concise [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for all modules, classes, and functions. Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for consistency.
    
- **Type Hinting:**  
    Use [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values. This enhances code readability and aids in static type checking.
    
    ```python
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b
    ```
    

### c. Version Control

- **Commit Messages:**  
    Write clear and descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This facilitates better understanding of project history and easier navigation.
    
    - **Format:**
        
        ```
        <type>[optional scope]: <description>
        
        [optional body]
        
        [optional footer(s)]
        ```
        
    - **Types:**
        
        - `feat`: A new feature
        - `fix`: A bug fix
        - `docs`: Documentation changes
        - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
        - `refactor`: Code refactoring without adding features or fixing bugs
        - `test`: Adding or updating tests
        - `chore`: Other changes (build tasks, package manager configs, etc.)

### d. Modular Design

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
    Structure the codebase to separate different functionalities into distinct modules and classes. This enhances maintainability and reusability.
    
- **Single Responsibility Principle:**  
    Ensure that each module, class, and function has a single, well-defined responsibility.
    

## 2. Development Workflow

### a. Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch:**  
    The `main` branch contains the stable and production-ready code.
    
- **Feature Branches:**  
    Create separate branches for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting. Merge them into `main` via pull requests after thorough review and testing.
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-model-architecture
    ```
    

### b. Pull Requests

- **Review Process:**  
    Submit pull requests (PRs) for all changes to the `main` branch. At least one other team member should review and approve the PR before merging.
    
- **Automated Checks:**  
    PRs trigger GitHub Actions workflows that run tests, linting, and security scans. Ensure all checks pass before requesting a review.
    

### c. Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**  
    Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of the project. Strive for high test coverage to ensure reliability.
    
- **Running Tests Locally:**  
    Execute the test suite locally before pushing changes.
    
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    

## 3. Security Practices

- **Secrets Management:**  
    Do not hard-code sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables and tools like GitHub Secrets to manage them securely.
    
- **Dependency Management:**  
    Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches and avoid vulnerabilities. Utilize Dependabot to automate dependency updates.
    
- **Static Code Analysis:**  
    Use tools like [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scan the codebase for security issues.
    
    ```bash
    bandit -r src/ scripts/ tests/
    ```
    

## 4. Performance Optimization

- **Profiling:**  
    Regularly profile training and inference processes to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
    
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:**  
    Optimize code to make effective use of computational resources, especially when training large models or processing extensive datasets.
    

## 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **Automated Workflows:**  
    GitHub Actions automate testing, linting, security scanning, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent and reliable integration.
    
- **Monitoring:**  
    Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track application performance and health in real-time.
    

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

- **Code of Conduct:**  
    Maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. Adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
    
- **Issue Reporting:**  
    Report bugs and request features by opening issues with clear and descriptive titles and detailed explanations.
    
- **Feature Requests:**  
    Discuss major changes or new features before implementation to ensure alignment with project goals.
    

## 7. License Compliance

- **GNU AGPLv3:**  
    Ensure all contributions comply with the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://chatgpt.com/c/license_information.md). This license requires that any modified versions of the project also be distributed under the same license terms.
