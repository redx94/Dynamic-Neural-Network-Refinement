# Dynamic Neural Network Refinement - Testing

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive testing strategies for ensuring robustness, accuracy, and security across all components of the Dynamic Neural Network Refinement project.

## Testing Strategies

## Unit Testing
- Modules are tested independently using the Pytest framework.
- Verifies the operational correctness of smart model adjustment.
- Top level unit tests are run to ensure that desired functionality is maintained.

## Integration Testing
- Tests support smooth data flow from training to model refinement.
- Checks activation logic with data adaptation modules.
- Ensures that real-time optimization does not introduce unacceptable lag during training.

## Stress Testing
- Load testing with different settings.
- Error injection to assess fortified network conditions.
 
## Running the Tests
To execute all tests, run the following command from the repository root:

```sh
pytest tests/
```
