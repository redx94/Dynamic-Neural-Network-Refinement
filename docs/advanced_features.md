- Knowledge Distillation: Trains a smaller "student" model to mimic the behavior of a larger "teacher" model.

### Using Scalability Optimizations

To use the scalability optimizations, you can use the `ScalabilityOptimizer` class in `src/scalability_optimizations.py`.

```python
import torch
from src.scalability_optimizations import ScalabilityOptimizer
from src.model import DynamicNeuralNetwork  # Replace with your actual model class

# Assuming you have a trained model
model = DynamicNeuralNetwork()  # Replace with your actual model initialization

optimizer = ScalabilityOptimizer(model)

# Apply structured pruning
optimizer.structured_pruning(amount=0.2)

# Prepare calibration data (replace with your actual calibration data)
calibration_data = [torch.randn(1, 28, 28) for _ in range(10)]

# Apply quantization
optimizer.quantize_model(calibration_data)

# Assuming you have a teacher model and training data
teacher_model = DynamicNeuralNetwork()  # Replace with your actual teacher model
train_loader = [(torch.randn(1, 28, 28), torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))) for _ in range(10)] # Replace with your actual training data

# Create a student model
student_model = DynamicNeuralNetwork()  # Replace with your actual student model

# Apply knowledge distillation
optimizer.apply_knowledge_distillation(student_model, teacher_model, train_loader)
```
