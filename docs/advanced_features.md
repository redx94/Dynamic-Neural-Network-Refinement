# Advanced Neural Network Features

## Quantum-Biological Integration
The integration of quantum computing principles with biological neural mechanisms creates a unique hybrid system capable of:
- Quantum state processing
- Biological neural dynamics
- Emergent intelligence patterns

## Implementation Details

### 1. Quantum Membrane Layer
```python
class QuantumMembrane(nn.Module):
    """
    Simulates quantum membrane potentials and field interactions.
    """
```

### 2. Biological Synapse Processing
```python
class BiologicalSynapse(nn.Module):
    """
    Models biological neural dynamics and synaptic interactions.
    """
```

### 3. Emergence Pattern Recognition
```python
class EmergencePatterns(nn.Module):
    """
    Enables spontaneous formation of intelligence patterns.
    """
```

## System Architecture
The system combines multiple advanced components:
1. Quantum processing units
2. Biological neural simulation
3. Emergent pattern recognition
4. Meta-consciousness integration

## Performance Considerations
- Quantum state maintenance
- Biological fidelity
- Pattern emergence stability
- Resource optimization
