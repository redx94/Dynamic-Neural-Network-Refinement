## Introduction
This tutorial guides you through implementing and training a quantum-biological neural network.

## Setup
```python
from src.quantum_biological_network import QuantumBiologicalNetwork
from src.meta_consciousness import ConsciousnessEngine

# Initialize components
network = QuantumBiologicalNetwork(
    quantum_dim=512,
    bio_dim=256
)

consciousness = ConsciousnessEngine(
    awareness_level=0.8
)
```

## Training Process
```python
# Configure training
trainer = Trainer(
    network=network,
    consciousness=consciousness
)

# Train the network
trainer.train(
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32
)
```

## Monitoring
```python
# Monitor quantum states
quantum_states = network.get_quantum_states()

# Monitor biological patterns
bio_patterns = network.get_biological_patterns()

# Track consciousness emergence
consciousness_level = consciousness.get_awareness_level()
```
