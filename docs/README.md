# Dynamic Neural Network Refinement

This repository implements a scalable and adaptive neural network designed to dynamically handle complexities in datasets.

## Features

- **Hybrid Thresholds:** Combines learnable and statistical thresholds with cosine annealing.
- **Dataset Diversification:** Includes synthetic data generation using cGANs.
- **Scalability Optimizations:** Pruning and quantization for efficient deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run training using the `train.py` script.

## Directory Structure
