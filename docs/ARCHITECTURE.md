# Dynamic Neural Network Refinement - Architecture

## Overview
Dynamic Neural Network Refinement (DNNR) is a flexible, adaptive, and continuously refining framework for ai models. It performs on-the-fly tuning of neural parameters, allowing for real-time model adjustment.

## Key Components

- **Adaptation Strategies:** Implement different strategies for adapting the neural network architecture during runtime.
- **Benchmarking Suite:** Provides tools for evaluating the performance of different network configurations.
- **Core Modules:** Contains the core logic for dynamic layer creation, evolutionary search, and fault tolerance.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Enables real-time monitoring of network performance and resource utilization.
- **Security Modules:** Implements security measures to protect the model from adversarial attacks.
