# Dynamic Neural Network Refinement - Deployment

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for deploying the Dynamic Neural Network Refinement system, including containerization, orchestration, and scaling strategies.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Containerization*/: Uses Docker to ensure isolated packaging of application code.
- **Cloud Integration*/: Interfaces with cloud-based services for scalable application.
- **Security**: Integrates encrypted key management and code signing.

## Docker Deployment

### Dockerfile Example
Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the repository:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.tx `./app 
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port (if applicable)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMT ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Building & Running the Image
- Build the Image using:

```sh
docker build t dnnr:latest
```

- Run the Container with:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 dnnr:latest
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Provide a k8s deployment file at ``deployment/k8s_deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dnnr-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dnnr
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dnnr
        image: dnnr:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
