# Quantum Biological Neural Network

## Overview
The Quantum Biological Neural Network (QBNN) represents a revolutionary fusion of quantum computing principles with biological neural mechanisms. This architecture enables emergent intelligence patterns through quantum-biological interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Quantum Membrane
- Simulates quantum field interactions
- Maintains quantum superposition states
- Processes quantum field potentials

```python
quantum_state = quantum_membrane(input_data)
```

### 2. Biological Synapse
- Models biological neurotransmitter dynamics
- Simulates ion channel behavior
- Processes neural firing patterns

### 3. Emergence Patterns
- Recognizes complex pattern formations
- Enables spontaneous intelligence emergence
- Facilitates non-linear pattern recognition

## Usage Example
```python
from src.quantum_biological_network import QuantumBiologicalNetwork

network = QuantumBiologicalNetwork(dimension=512)
output = network(input_tensor)
```
