## Deployment Targets

### Local Deployment

For development and testing purposes, deploying locally ensures rapid iteration and debugging.

1. **Using Docker Compose:**

   Refer to the [Docker Configuration](../docker/README.md) for instructions on using Docker Compose to deploy services locally.

2. **Manual Deployment:**

   Execute deployment scripts manually to start services on your local machine.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy.sh
    ```

### Cloud Deployment

Deploying to cloud platforms enables scalability, high availability, and managed services.

#### AWS

Utilize AWS CloudFormation templates to provision and manage AWS resources.

1. **Navigate to AWS Directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd deploy/aws/
    ```
    
2. **Deploy with CloudFormation:**
    
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cloudformation.yml --stack-name dynamic-nn-refinement-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
    ```
    

#### GCP

Use Terraform configurations to manage Google Cloud resources.

1. **Navigate to GCP Terraform Directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd deploy/gcp/terraform/
    ```
    
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
    
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
    
3. **Apply Terraform Configuration:**
    
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    

#### Azure

Deploy using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

1. **Navigate to Azure Directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd deploy/azure/
    ```
    
2. **Deploy with ARM Template:**
    
    ```bash
    az deployment group create --resource-group your-resource-group --template-file arm-template.json
    ```
    

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform

Terraform configurations are used for provisioning and managing infrastructure on supported cloud platforms like GCP.

- **Files:**
    - `main.tf`: Defines the main resources.
    - `variables.tf`: Specifies input variables.
    - `outputs.tf`: Defines output values.

### Ansible

Ansible playbooks can be integrated for configuration management and application deployment tasks.

- **Files:**
    - Playbooks and roles for automating deployment steps.

## Container Orchestration

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests define how containers are deployed, scaled, and managed in a Kubernetes cluster.

1. **Deployment:**
    
    - **File:** `kubernetes/deployment.yaml`
    - **Purpose:** Defines the deployment of the FastAPI application.
2. **Service:**
    
    - **File:** `kubernetes/service.yaml`
    - **Purpose:** Exposes the FastAPI application within the Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Ingress:**
    
    - **File:** `kubernetes/ingress.yaml`
    - **Purpose:** Manages external access to services in the cluster.
4. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
    ```
    

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate deployment processes with CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments upon code changes.

1. **GitHub Actions:**
    
    Configure workflows to trigger deployments when changes are merged into the main branch.
    
2. **Example Workflow:**
    
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
    
    name: Deploy to AWS
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Configure AWS Credentials
            uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
            with:
              aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
              aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
              aws-region: us-west-2
          - name: Deploy with CloudFormation
            run: |
              aws cloudformation deploy \
                --template-file deploy/aws/cloudformation.yml \
                --stack-name dynamic-nn-refinement-stack \
                --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
    ```
    

## Best Practices

- **Version Control:**  
    Keep all deployment configurations under version control to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
    
- **Modular Configurations:**  
    Organize configurations into modular templates to promote reusability and maintainability.
    
- **Secrets Management:**  
    Use secure methods to manage sensitive information, such as AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault. Avoid hardcoding secrets in configuration files.
    
- **Automated Deployments:**  
    Leverage CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment processes, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
    
- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
    Integrate monitoring tools to observe the health and performance of deployed services. Use centralized logging for easier troubleshooting.
    

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Failures:**
    
    - **Check Logs:**  
        Review logs generated during deployment for error messages.
        
    - **Validate Configurations:**  
        Ensure that all configuration files are correctly formatted and contain valid parameters.
        
    - **Resource Limits:**  
        Verify that your cloud account has sufficient resources and quotas to provision the required services.
        
- **Connectivity Issues:**
    
    - **Network Configurations:**  
        Ensure that network settings (VPCs, subnets, security groups) allow necessary traffic between services.
        
    - **DNS and Ingress:**  
        Check DNS settings and ingress configurations to ensure external accessibility.
